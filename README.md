**Download the stable release. In game, this version is referred to as Twitch Emotes. The reason is that the one called Winterfur Emotes for some reason breaks animated emotes and I'm very silly. Even if it's called Twitch Emotes, you can download the version that only has Winterfur Emotes if you want**

Just an edit of the addon Twitch Emotes v2 by ren9790 for personal use

If you want only Winterfur emotes download the one just saying Winterfur Emotes, if you also want Twitch Emotes choose Winterfur + Twitch Emotes

Install guide:
* Choose if you want only Winterfur emotes or Winterfur + Twitch emotes by either clicking on **STABLE RELEASE: Winterfur Emotes v.x.y.z**" for Winterfur only or "**STABLE RELEASE: Winterfur + Twitch Emotes v.x.y.z**" for Winterfur + Twitch
* After clicking on the corresponding version, download the zip file by clicking on the button titled RAW in the top right
* Navigate to the addons folder of your wow installation. If you are unsure where this is, you can click the gear icon next to Play in battlenet and then hit "Show in Explorer" ...World of Warcraft\\_classic_\\Interface\\addons
* Extract the contents of the .zip into said folder (that's to say, copy over the folder called TwitchEmotes)
* Enable addon in game
